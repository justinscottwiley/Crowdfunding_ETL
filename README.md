# Crowdfunding_ETL

 This project has a few different examples of reading this crowdfunding data. The first part of this was done on Jupyter Notebook to fill out the workbook and to create four individual CSV files to read this data. The data frames contain campaign, category, subcategory, and contacts data. These were then imported to SQL to give another example of reading the data frames. A ERD diagram was created to show the path used to importing purposes on SQL.
